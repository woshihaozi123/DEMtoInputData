# 1. Load DEM data
dem_file = "path/to/dem.tif"
dataset = gdal.Open(dem_file)
dem = dataset.ReadAsArray()

# 2. Preprocess DEM (Fill catchments, remove outliers, or smooth elevation values)

# 3. Calculate flow direction
flow_direction = calculate_flow_direction(dem)  # Custom function to calculate flow direction based on DEM

# 4. Calculate flow accumulation
flow_accumulation = calculate_flow_accumulation(flow_direction)  # Custom function to calculate flow accumulation based on flow direction

# 5. Calculate distance to nearest drainage
distance_to_drainage = calculate_distance_to_drainage(flow_accumulation)  # Custom function to calculate distance to nearest drainage based on flow accumulation

# 6. Generate HAND model
hand = dem - distance_to_drainage

# 7. Post-processing (post-processing steps are omitted here)

# 8. Visualize or save the HAND model (visualization or saving steps are omitted here)
